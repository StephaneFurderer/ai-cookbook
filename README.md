# Introduction
Let’s build something practical today. 
A rapid-prototyping automation for insurance operations, powered by Python, n8n and FastAPI. 

Our use case is a travel-insurance company. 
Your core risk exposure is the number of travelers flying into specific airports across your portfolio. 
When a hurricane begins to form in the Atlantic, you need to know, fast, how many travelers are heading into the impact zone.

By the end of this session, you’ll have a pipeline that 
- watches emerging events,
- reads the signals,
- predicts the exposure,
- and alerts your operations automatically.

No scrambling. No manual stitching. 
A service that pulls event data every day, blends it with your traveler volumes, estimates who’s at risk, and sends a clear action straight to your ops inbox through Gmail.

One small system, reliable, and tailored to your risks. 
And after today, you’ll know how to build it yourself so that your team can move quicly when it matters.
