# Introduction
Let’s build something practical today. 
A rapid-prototyping automation for insurance operations, powered by Python, n8n and FastAPI. 

We’ll start simple and end with something real. 
So that by the end of this session, you’ll have a pipeline that 
- watches emerging events,
- reads the signals,
- and helps your ops act fast.

Think hurricanes forming in the Atlantic. 
Airports in the impact zone. 
Travelers moving through your portfolio day by day. 

Instead of scrambling, you’ll have a service that estimates exposure automatically on a daily basis. 
You'll be able to 
(1) pull event data, 
(2) matche it with your predictive model to count the number of travelers at risk,
(3) and sends clear actions straight to your operations inbox through Gmail.

One small system, reliable, and tailored to your risks. 
And after today, you’ll know how to build it yourself.
